A version of my earlier password generator with a tkinter GUI.
This version also has a password manager in the form of text files.

**HOW TO USE:**
1. Enter a number that represents how long the password should be.
2. Select wether special characters, numbers or uppercase letters should be included in the password.
3. Generate the password.
4. OPTIONAL: Enter a name for the file (preferably the name of the service associated with the password).
5. OPTIONAL: Enter a username to associate with the password.
6. OPTIONAL: Save password to file.
